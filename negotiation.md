Here’s a structured **negotiation strategy** tailored to your situation, emphasizing your **expanded responsibilities, resilience, and market compensation**.

---

### **🔹 Step 1: Prepare Your Key Points**
Before negotiations, clearly outline why you're deserving of the **Director** role and how you've gone above and beyond a typical **Senior Engineering Manager**:

1. **Expanded Scope of Responsibility**
    - You **inherited the payments team** (4 engineers) 1.5 years ago, a business-critical team.
    - You **took over tech support management** a year ago, expanding your leadership impact.
    - Despite **losing two Senior Engineers**, you **kept the team highly efficient** and delivered key projects.

2. **Major Business Impact**
    - You **led high-stakes payment initiatives**, ensuring compliance, reducing fraud, and optimizing costs.
    - You improved **release success rates** (97% last year) and **efficiency in payment processing**.
    - You implemented **AI initiatives** and **automation** to drive engineering productivity.

3. **Alignment with Director-Level Responsibilities**
    - You already manage **multiple teams** (Payments & Tech Support).
    - You **lead cross-functional efforts** with engineering, product, and compliance.
    - Your role impacts **business outcomes, security, compliance, and cost savings**—not just engineering execution.

4. **Market Compensation Benchmarking**
    - In **West Des Moines**, Senior Engineering Managers earn **$236K total comp**, while Directors earn **$262K total comp**.
    - Your **current responsibilities exceed Senior Manager scope**, so Director-level compensation is fair.

### **🔹 Step 2: Negotiation Script for Director Title**
If they offer **Senior Engineering Manager**, but you want **Director**, use this:

**You:**  
*"I really appreciate this offer and the recognition of my contributions. Over the last 1.5 years, I’ve taken on critical leadership responsibilities, including inheriting the payments team, leading tech support, and maintaining high performance despite team turnover. Given my scope and the strategic impact of my role, I strongly believe that the Director title aligns with my contributions and future impact on the company."*

*"I’d love to discuss how we can structure this role at the Director level, ensuring I can continue to drive cross-team initiatives, compliance efforts, and fintech innovation."*

---

### **🔹 Step 3: If They Insist on Senior Manager**
If they **push back on Director**, use this to maximize compensation:

1. **Request a Compensation Adjustment Closer to Director Level**
    - *“I understand if a Director title isn’t available at this moment, but I want to ensure my compensation reflects my current impact. Based on market benchmarks, I’d expect my total compensation to be closer to the Director level.”*
    - **Ask for:** A **higher base salary**, **increased bonus (20-30%)**, and **stronger equity/RSUs**.

2. **Set a Clear Timeline for Director Promotion**
    - *“I’d like to establish a clear growth plan to move into the Director role within the next 6-12 months. Can we outline the expectations and key milestones to achieve this transition?”*
    - **Ask for:** A written plan with quarterly check-ins.

3. **Secure Additional Perks** (if comp flexibility is limited)
    - **Equity Refresh Grant** (to align with long-term company growth).
    - **Increased Bonus Structure** (20-30% to match Director incentives).
    - **More Budget for Your Team** (headcount, tools, training).

---

### **🔹 Step 4: Final Leverage – Alternative Offers**
If necessary, be prepared to mention:
- **External Market Demand:** *"Given my experience and scope, I’ve seen Director-level roles available in the market. I’d love to continue my growth here, but I also want to ensure my compensation reflects my role."*
- **Internal Retention Risk:** Losing a leader who **manages multiple teams and delivers fintech-critical work** would be costly to replace.

---

### **🔹 Final Thoughts**
- **If they agree to Director:** Fantastic! Make sure your **compensation package is competitive.**
- **If they push Senior Manager:** Maximize **salary, equity, and promotion timeline.**
- **If they lowball:** Consider **external Director opportunities** for leverage.
