Absolutely! Your expanded scope of responsibilitiesâ€”**inheriting the payments team, managing tech support, and keeping things running efficiently despite losing two senior engineers**â€”is strong evidence that youâ€™ve already been operating at a **Director level**. Hereâ€™s your updated script incorporating those points:

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Opening: Appreciation & Reaffirming Your Goal**
*"I really appreciate this opportunity and the recognition of my contributions. As Iâ€™ve shared before, my long-term goal has always been to grow into a Director role. Given the impact Iâ€™ve had and the increased leadership responsibilities Iâ€™ve taken on over the past year and a half, Iâ€™d love to discuss how I can step into that position now."*

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Framing Your Case: Leadership, Business Impact & Execution**
*"In the past 18 months, Iâ€™ve taken on significantly expanded leadership responsibilities beyond my original role:*

âœ… **Expanded Team Leadership & Stability:**
- *Inherited the **payments team (4 engineers)** after downsizing and ensured continued strong execution.*
- *Took over **management of the tech support team**, broadening my leadership scope beyond engineering.*
- *Kept the team efficient and delivering on key projects, despite losing two senior software engineers.*

âœ… **Business & Technical Impact:**
- *Saved **$500/month on Sentry** and **$400/month on Mandrill** through cost optimization.*
- *Implemented **automated release tracking**, saving 1 hour per release and increasing efficiency.*
- *Led major refactors to improve system reliability and maintainability.*
- *Increased **release success to 97%** last year across 36 releases.*
- *Strengthened **security & compliance**, leading the implementation of OpenAPI specs and encryption.*
- *Driving **AI-powered consumer acquisition**, directly impacting company growth goals.*

*"In addition to delivering on core projects, Iâ€™ve played a key role in stabilizing and scaling teams, ensuring continuity in payments and tech support, and executing on critical fintech and compliance initiatives. These are Director-level responsibilities that Iâ€™ve been handling successfully for quite some time."*

### **ðŸ”¹ If They Offer Senior Manager Instead of Director**
#### **â†’ Ask for Clarity on the Gap**
*"I appreciate the offer for Senior Manager, but given my leadership over multiple teams and the continued delivery on key initiatives, Iâ€™d love to understand what specific gaps remain between my current impact and the Director level. Based on my contributions, I believe Iâ€™m already operating at that level."*

#### **â†’ Negotiate a Clear Promotion Path**
*"If Director isnâ€™t possible right now, can we define a clear path to that role within the next 6 months? Iâ€™d like to align on measurable milestones and a timeline to ensure Iâ€™m positioned for that step."*

#### **â†’ Expand the Roleâ€™s Scope**
*"If the immediate step is Senior Manager, Iâ€™d like to ensure the role includes Director-level responsibilitiesâ€”such as cross-functional leadership, strategic planning, and ownership of larger initiativesâ€”with a clear timeline for title alignment."*

---

### **ðŸ”¹ If They Hesitate**
*"Iâ€™m committed to continuing to drive impact at the highest level, and I want to ensure Iâ€™m in a role where I can make the most difference. If Director isnâ€™t an option here, I may need to explore where I can take on that level of responsibility."*

(Use this only if youâ€™re willing to push for a **real commitment** or consider other options.)

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Closing**
*"I appreciate this conversation and your support in my growth. Whether itâ€™s stepping into Director now or setting a short-term path to get there, Iâ€™m committed to driving results and leading at that level."*

---

### **ðŸ”¥ Final Power Moves**
âœ… **Highlight your expanded scope** â€“ Payments, tech support, and execution despite losing engineers.  
âœ… **Show them youâ€™re already doing the job** â€“ A promotion is just aligning the title.  
âœ… **Push for clear next steps** â€“ Either **Director now** or a **6-month roadmap with defined criteria.**  
âœ… **If they hesitate, leverage your value** â€“ They **need** you at this level.

This version makes an even stronger case that you **deserve Director now, not later**. Let me know if you want to tweak anything further! ðŸš€
